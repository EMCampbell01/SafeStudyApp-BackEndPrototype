# SafeStudyApp-BackEndPrototype
Napier Hackathon Submission

SafeStudy App

The concept for the SafeStudy App was developed as a submission for Edinburgh Napiers 2021 start of year hackathon.

The app is designed to allow for students to create and join study groups.
Study groups are able to arrange meetings at a set time and place.
If a member of a study group tests positive for Covid-19, all their group members are alerted

This repository contains a prototype to demo the back-end functionality of the SafeStudyApp

The front-end app gui was developed seperatly and can be found here: adel2924/StudyAppHackathon
